Game: 	Bombs survival

So for this game my only objective is creating the experience of tension and fun. 
To achieve this I used the following ways:

1. By using bombs in my concept it will already give the player a certain tenstion, because everyone 
knows bombs will eventually explode. Trying to survive the bombs is what makes the ultimate tension.


2. By speeding up the falling bombs and the time it will explode, this will keep adding tension until
the player totally panics. THis panic is what will make this game a challenge and fun to play.

3. To diffuse the bombs you need to push the right keybutton. The bombs however will pulsate faster and 
faster when they touch the ground, trying to confuse your eyevision so that you will make a mistake. 
Trying to train your memmory and keeping focus adds even more tension and playfullness to the experience.

4. THe direction of the bombs and which bomb is falling are random, making it impossible to guess what comes 
next and where it will come. This creates alot more confusion which is needed for the right tension and enjoyment.

5. All the points made above will get harder and harder when you're making progress in the game. Players
off course won't notice it directly, but eventually when you do...it's too late. You won't have time
to stay calm and have to try harder and harder to stay alive.
